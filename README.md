# AIProjectActiGence

<b><u> Overview </u></b>

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze and make predictions on financial data. Using a combination of Python libraries and technical indicators, it demonstrates a robust pipeline for processing, visualizing, and forecasting stock prices.

<b><u>Features</u></b>

**Data Collection**: Stock price data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

**Preprocessing**: Prepares and cleans financial time-series data.

**Visualization**: Uses matplotlib for visualizing trends and patterns in the data.

**Modeling**: Implements LSTM neural networks for sequence prediction using TensorFlow.

**Evaluation**: Provides insights into model performance using various metrics.


**Required Libraries**

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy

- pandas

- matplotlib

- tensorflow

- yfinance

- datetime


**Usage**

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

- Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (AI-LSTM-Technical.ipynb).

- Follow the steps outlined in the notebook:
