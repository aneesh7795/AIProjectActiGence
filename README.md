# Overview

This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze and make predictions on financial data. Using a combination of Python libraries and technical indicators, it demonstrates a robust pipeline for processing, visualizing, and forecasting stock prices.

Features

Data Collection: Stock price data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Preprocessing: Prepares and cleans financial time-series data.

Visualization: Uses matplotlib for visualizing trends and patterns in the data.

Modeling: Implements LSTM neural networks for sequence prediction using TensorFlow.

Evaluation: Provides insights into model performance using various metrics.
